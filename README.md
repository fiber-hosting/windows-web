It's so useless, I've made Windows 10 style settings window in HTML / CSS / JS.

So...
I don't know if I'll add something more. Maybe more tabs, and replace all icons as the .svg.

Basically I was just bored.

**Some comparison**

Icons are different, because I didn't want to copy Windows' icons.
Some things are a little bit too big or too small.
Yeah.. That's it.

Maybe I'll add more tabs but who knows.
I've tested it on Chrome, Edge (custom scrollbar didn't work), Opera and Firefox.

*This is my first thing on GitHub, I should use probably a CodePen, but it wasn't able to transform my code into normal-looking window.*
